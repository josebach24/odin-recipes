    <h2>Description</h2>
    Fettuccine Alfredo is a classic Italian pasta dish that features a rich and creamy sauce made from butter, cream, and Parmesan cheese. 
    To make it, start by cooking fettuccine noodles according to package instructions. 
    In a separate saucepan, melt butter and heavy cream together over low heat. 
    Once melted, add grated Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese has melted and the sauce is smooth. 
    Toss the cooked pasta in the sauce and serve immediately, garnished with additional grated Parmesan cheese and freshly chopped parsley, if desired.

    Another variation of this dish involves adding saut√©ed garlic and onion to the butter and cream mixture, as well as a splash of white wine, to add depth of flavor. 
    You can also experiment with using different types of pasta, such as linguine or spaghetti, 
    and adding cooked chicken or shrimp to the dish for a heartier meal.
