    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that typically consists of layers of pasta, cheese, and meat or vegetables. 
        To make lasagna, you will need lasagna noodles, tomato sauce, ground beef, ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, parmesan cheese, garlic, onion, and seasonings.
        To start, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions and set them aside.
        Next, brown the ground beef in a pan with diced onion and garlic, and then add the tomato sauce and seasonings. In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and parmesan cheese. To assemble the lasagna, spread a layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a baking dish, followed by a layer of noodles, a layer of the cheese mixture, and then repeat the layers. Finally, bake the lasagna in the oven until it is bubbly and golden brown. 
        Serve hot and enjoy!</p>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic until the meat is browned and the onion is tender.
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, sugar, salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons of the parsley to the skillet. Simmer for 1-2 hours, stirring occasionally.
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to package directions, and drain.
