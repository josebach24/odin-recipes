    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Margherita pizza is a classic Italian pizza that is typically made with a thin crust, tomato sauce, 
        fresh mozzarella cheese, basil, and olive oil. The crust is usually baked until it is crispy and golden brown,
         and the sauce is made from fresh tomatoes that are seasoned with garlic and other herbs. 
         The mozzarella cheese is placed on top of the sauce, and the pizza is finished with a sprinkle of fresh basil and a drizzle of olive oil. 
        The result is a delicious and simple pizza that is loved by many for its fresh and bright flavors.</p>
